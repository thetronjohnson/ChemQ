# ChemQ
ChemQ is a project to identify the properties of an organic compound
ChemQ also aims to predict if a compound is toxic or not

## Description
ChemQ creates images of organic compounds from the structure stored in Dataset
Then with Deep Learning recognise toxic and non-toxic compounds from the image
The data sets may also contain further information about the compound which can be used to make other predictions
and identify the characteristics of the compound

Future developments may include:
* comparing two molecules
* identifying a compound with a similar structure( present in the dataset )

The project is still in its inital stage. Feel free to help with suggestions and other contibutions
